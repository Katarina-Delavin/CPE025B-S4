                <h3>Part 1: The Hen's Discovery</h3>
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a little red hen who lived on a farm. One day, she found some grains of wheat.</p>
                <p>"Who will help me plant this wheat?" asked the hen.</p>
                <p>"Not I," said the dog. "Not I," said the cat. "Not I," said the duck.</p>
                <h3>Part 2: Planting and Growing</h3>
                <p>So the little red hen planted the wheat all by herself. She watered it and watched it grow into tall stalks.</p>
                <p>When the wheat was ready, she asked, "Who will help me harvest the wheat?"</p>
                <p>"Not I," said the dog. "Not I," said the cat. "Not I," said the duck.</p>
                <h3>Part 3: Making Bread</h3>
                <p>The hen took the wheat to the mill and ground it into flour. Then she made dough and baked it into bread.</p>
                <p>When the bread was done, she asked, "Who will help me eat this bread?"</p>
                <p>"I will!" said the dog. "I will!" said the cat. "I will!" said the duck.</p>
                <p>But the little red hen said, "No, you didn't help me plant or harvest or bake. You can watch me eat it all by myself."</p>
                <p>And she did. The end.</p>
